Clone the repo to get a local copy of the files. git clone https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky.git

Download CircuitPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico. *Updated to 8.0.0
Download CircuitPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico W. *Updated to 8.0.0

Plug the device into a USB port while holding the boot button. It will show up as a removable media device named RPI-RP2.

Copy the downloaded .uf2 file to the root of the Pico (RPI-RP2). The device will reboot and after a second or so, it will reconnect as CIRCUITPY.

Download adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-YYYYMMDD.zip here and extract it outside the device.

Navigate to lib in the recently extracted folder and copy adafruit_hid to the lib folder on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Copy adafruit_debouncer.mpy and adafruit_ticks.mpy to the lib folder on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

Copy asyncio to the lib folder on your Pico.

Copy adafruit_wsgi to the lib folder on your Pico.

Copy boot.py from your clone to the root of your Pico.

Copy duckyinpython.py, code.py, webapp.py, wsgiserver.py to the root folder of the Pico.

For Pico W Only Create the file secrets.py in the root of the Pico W. This contains the AP name and password to be created by the Pico W.
secrets = { 'ssid' : "BadAPName", 'password' : "badpassword" }

Find a script here or create your own one using Ducky Script and save it as payload.dd in the Pico. Currently, pico-ducky only supports DuckyScript 1.0, not 3.0.

Be careful, if your device isn't in setup mode, the device will reboot and after half a second, the script will run.

Please note: by default Pico W will not show as a USB drive
